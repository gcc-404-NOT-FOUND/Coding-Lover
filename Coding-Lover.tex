\title{Coding Lover}
\subtitle{Hobbies and Interests}

\section{Beginning}
While most teenagers chase fleeting trends, I found my obsession in the cold logic of code—where every semicolon echoes with purpose.
\section{History}
I was first introduced to programming on September 1, 2023, when I started learning Scratch. Later, in September 2024, during my first IT lab class, I encountered the C++ language. From wrestling with pointer arithmetic in C++ to crafting typeset masterpieces with LaTeX, each segment of memory allocation became a personal playground. My inaugural open-source project\footnote{Project URL: \url{https://github.com/gcc-404-NOT-FOUND/Red-Star-over-China}} documented a political classic through LaTeX—typesetting became my silent protest against mediocre formatting.
\section{Why do I love}
Throughout my learning journey, I’ve adhered to the principle: If I can’t afford it or it’s not available, I’ll make it myself. I often spend at least three hours in one sitting while coding. I truly enjoy the sense of control over how the code runs and the output it produces. Every time I update my code, I feel a great sense of accomplishment.
\section{Ending}
In summary, programming is the only hobby I’ve consistently pursued for over a year. I’m currently learning C++, LaTeX, and Python. Find me reverse-engineering life’s stack trace at GitHub, where pull requests speak louder than platitudes. Oh, you haven't subscribed my GitHub account \url{https://github.com/gcc-404-NOT-FOUND} yet,right?
